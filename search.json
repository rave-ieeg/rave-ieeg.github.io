Copy the command line shown below into the terminal window.\n sudo ls\nYou will be prompted for a password. This is the password of the MacOS account you are logged in as. If you have an admin account, MacOS will show the files in the current directory. If not, you will receive an error message. Alternately, click anywhere on the desktop to activate the MacOS menu bar, click on the Apple icon at the top left of the menu bar, then “System Preferences” or “System Settings”, then “Users & Groups”.

Open this folder and double-click on the R icon to start R. After starting R, we recommend that you right-click on the R icon in the Dock and select “Options”/“Keep in Dock” to make it easier to launch with a single click. We also recommend starting R, opening the “Preferences”/“Startup” tab, and change “Save workspace on exit from”R” to “No”. Uncheck the box “Read history file on startup”. To check the current version of “R”, start R and enter the following into the console:\nR.version\nThis will produce a number of lines of output, beginning with something like\n platform       x86_64-apple-darwin17.0     \n arch           x86_64\n\n\n\nInstallation requires the latest version of the homebrew package manager.

Pick one to see the format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n# Header 1\nHeader 1\n\n\n## Header 2\nHeader 2\n\n\n### Header 3\nHeader 3\n\n\n#### Header 4\nHeader 4\n\n\n##### Header 5\nHeader 5\n\n\n###### Header 6\nHeader 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Formatting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***\nitalics, bold, bold italics\n\n\nsuperscript^2^ / subscript~2~\nsuperscript2 / subscript2\n\n\n~~strikethrough~~\nstrikethrough\n\n\n`verbatim code`\nverbatim code\n\n\n&gt; Blockquote\n\nBlockquote\n\n\n\n::: {.classname}\nDiv\n:::\n\nDiv\n\n\n\n| Line Block\n|   Spaces and newlines\n|   are preserved\nLine Block\n   Spaces and newlines\n   are preserved\n\n\nendash: --\nendash: –\n\n\nemdash: ---\nemdash: —\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n* unordered list\n    + sub-item 1\n    + sub-item 2\n        - sub-sub-item 1\n\nunordered list\n\nsub-item 1\nsub-item 2\n\nsub-sub-item 1\n\n\n\n\n\n*   item 2\n\n    Continued (indent 4 spaces)\n\nitem 2\nContinued (indent 4 spaces)\n\n\n\n1. ordered list\n2. item 2\n    i) sub-item 1\n         A.  sub-sub-item 1\n\nordered list\nitem 2\n\nsub-item 1\n\nsub-sub-item 1\n\n\n\n\n\n- [ ] Task 1\n- [x] Task 2\n\nTask 1\nTask 2\n\n\n\n(@)  A list whose numbering\n\ncontinues after\n\n(@)  an interruption\n\nA list whose numbering\n\ncontinues after\n\nan interruption\n\n\n\n::: {}\n1.

Otherwise the list will not be rendered in list form, rather it will all appear as normal text along a single line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes1\n\n\n\n\n\nPandoc supports numbering and formatting footnotes using the following syntax:\nHere is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]\n\n[^1]: Here is the footnote.\n\n[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.\n\n    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they\nbelong to the previous footnote.\n\n        { some.code }\n\n    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first\n    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like\n    multi-paragraph list items.\n\nThis paragraph won't be part of the note, because it\nisn't indented.\nThe above syntax generates the following output:\n\nHere is a footnote reference,2 and another.3\nThis paragraph won’t be part of the note, because it isn’t indented.\n\nIn addition, you can also write single paragraph footnotes inline using the following syntax:\nHere is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write,\nsince you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to\ntype the note.]\nThis syntax generates the following output:\n\nHere is an inline note.4\n\nThe footnotes that are generated from the above examples are included in the Example Footnotes section at the bottom of the page. See the Pandoc Footnotes for additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia (link, figure, video, …) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks & Images\nIf you want to include your own figures, please upload figures from Github. Make sure the figure is at the same directory as the markdown file.\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n&lt;https://rave.wiki&gt;\nlink\nhttps://rave.wiki\n\n\n[RAVE Website](https://rave.wiki)\nlink with different text\nRAVE Website\n\n\n![Caption](rave-neuroimage.webp)\nimage\n\n\n\nCaption\n\n\n\n\n![Caption](rave-neuroimage.webp){width=\"30%\"}\nimage with 30% width\n\n\n\nCaption\n\n\n\n\n[![Caption](rave-neuroimage.webp){width=\"30%\"}](https://rave.wiki)\nimage with link\n\n\n\n[![Caption](rave-neuroimage.webp \"RAVE\"){width=\"30%\"}](https://rave.wiki)\nimage with link and tooltip (hover text)\n\n\n\n[![](missing-image.webp){width=\"30%\" fig-alt=\"ss\"}](https://rave.wiki)\nimage with link: alt-text when image is missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\nYou can include videos in documents using the {{&lt; video &gt;}} shortcode. For example, here we embed a YouTube video:\n{{&lt; video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfHZMfqIaGY &gt;}}\nVideos can refer to video files (e.g. MPEG) or can be links to videos published on YouTube, Vimeo, or Brightcove.

If your language is not supported then you can use the default language to get a similar visual treatment:\n```default\ncode\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(E_{quations}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nUse $ delimiters for inline math and $$ delimiters for display math. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\ninline math: $E = mc^{2}$\ninline math: \\(E=mc^{2}\\)\n\n\ndisplay math:\n\n$$E = mc^{2}$$\ndisplay math:\n\\[E = mc^{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some advanced usages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;HTML code&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw content without parsing\nRaw content can be included directly without parsing it. A raw block starts with ```{= followed by a format and closing }, e.g. here’s a raw HTML block:\n```{=html}\n&lt;iframe src=\"https://rave.wiki/\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n```\n\n\nDivs and Spans\nFor HTML &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags, there is a better option. You can add classes, attributes, and other identifiers to regions of content using Divs and Spans. The difference between this type and “raw” content above is that the content inside ::: will be parsed as markdown.\nFor example, here we add the “border” class to a region of content using a div (:::):\n::: {.border}\nThis content can be styled with a border\n:::\nOnce rendered to HTML, Quarto will translate the markdown into:\n&lt;div class=\"border\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;This content can be styled with a border&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nDivs start with a fence containing at least three consecutive colons plus some attributes. The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons. The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The Div should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks. Divs may also be nested. For example\n::::: {#special .sidebar}\n\n::: {.warning}\nHere is a warning.\n:::\n\nMore content.\n:::::\nOnce rendered to HTML, Quarto will translate the markdown into:\n&lt;div id=\"special\" class=\"sidebar\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"warning\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Here is a warning.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;More content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nFences without attributes are always closing fences. Unlike with fenced code blocks, the number of colons in the closing fence need not match the number in the opening fence. However, it can be helpful for visual clarity to use fences of different lengths to distinguish nested divs from their parents.\nA bracketed sequence of inlines, as one would use to begin a link, will be treated as a Span with attributes if it is followed immediately by attributes:\n[This is *some text*]{.class key=\"val\"}\nOnce rendered to HTML, Quarto will translate the markdown into:\n&lt;span class=\"class\" data-key=\"val\"&gt;\n  This is &lt;em&gt;some text&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallouts (collapsible content)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout\nCallouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.\nThere are five different types of callouts available.\n\nnote\nwarning\nimportant\ntip\ncaution\n\nThe color and icon will be different depending upon the type that you select. Here are what the various types look like in HTML output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, tip, warning, caution, and important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCallouts provide a simple way to attract attention, for example, to this warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Important\n\n\n\nDanger, callouts will really improve your writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip With Title\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a ‘collapsed’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nCreate callouts in markdown using the following syntax (note that the first markdown heading used within the callout is used as the callout heading):\n::: {.callout-note}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip with Title\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Expand To Learn About Collapse\n\nThis is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse=\"true\"` to collapse it by default or `collapse=\"false\"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n:::\nNote that above callout titles are defined by using a heading at the top of the callout. If you prefer, you can also specify the title using the title attribute. For example:\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Tip with Title\"}\nThis is a callout with a title.\n:::\n\nCustomizing Appearance\n\nCollapse\nYou can create ‘folded’ callouts that can be expanded by the user by settings the collapse attribute on the callout. If you set collapse=true, the callout will be expandable, but will be collapsed by default. If you set collapse=false, the callout will be expandable, but will be expanded by default.\n\n\nAppearance\nCallouts have 3 different looks you can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault\nThe default appearance with colored header and an icon.\n\n\nsimple\nA lighter weight appearance that doesn’t include a colored header background.\n\n\nminimal\nA minimal treatment that applies borders to the callout, but doesn’t include a header background color or icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop-up dialogue (modal)\n\n\n\n\n\nModal is a great way to show dialogues with a catchy button. Here is an example:\n::: {.rave-modal data-type=\"botton\" data-class=\"btn btn-primary\" data-label=\"Click me!\" data-title=\"I am the title!\"}\n\nRAVE is a very powerful tool!\n\n:::\nOutput:\n\nRAVE is a very powerful tool!\n\nExplanation:\n\nElement class .rave-modal will let this website mark the content as modal content;\ndata-type=\"botton\" creates a button;\ndata-label will become the button label;\ndata-title is the title of pop-up dialogue;\ndata-class=\"btn btn-primary\" styles the button with solid primary background. Common styles are:\n\nNormal\ndata-class=“btn btn-primary” data-class=“btn btn-secondary” data-class=“btn btn-success” data-class=“btn btn-danger” data-class=“btn btn-warning” data-class=“btn btn-info” data-class=“btn btn-light” data-class=“btn btn-dark”\nOutlined\ndata-class=“btn btn-outline-primary” data-class=“btn btn-outline-secondary” data-class=“btn btn-outline-success” data-class=“btn btn-outline-danger” data-class=“btn btn-outline-warning” data-class=“btn btn-outline-info” data-class=“btn btn-outline-light” data-class=“btn btn-outline-dark”\nSize\ndata-class=“btn btn-lg btn-primary” data-class=“btn btn-sm btn-primary”\n\n\nHere is an example of customization:\n* ::: {.rave-modal data-type=\"span\" data-class=\"text-decoration-underline\" data-label=\"Click this link to show the message!\" data-title=\"Hello World!\"}\n  RAVE is a very powerful tool!\n  :::\n* ::: {.rave-modal data-type=\"span\" data-class=\"text-decoration-underline\" data-label=\"How about this one?\" data-title=\"Hello Again!\"}\n  RAVE is indeed a very powerful tool!\n  :::\nOutput:\n\n\nRAVE is a very powerful tool!\n\n\nRAVE is indeed a very powerful tool!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument {snippets}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a document is too long, it is a good practice to break it down into several small snippets.\nFor example, the main source of this document how-to-edit-this-website.md only has around 200 lines. Most of the formatting details are separated out into small snippets.\nTo create a snippet, simply create a markdown document whose name starts with an underscore _. For example _markdown-advanced-snippet.md is the file name of text you are reading. Each document snippet is just a normal markdown file. They can be independently edited.\nTo include the snippet into the main document, you can use the following markdown:\n{{&lt; include _markdown-advanced-snippet.md &gt;}}\nDocument snippets work well with callouts and pop-up modals.\n\nHere’s an example using callouts\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n### Document `{`snippets`}` \n\n{{&lt; include _markdown-advanced-snippet.md &gt;}}\n:::\nThis is an example using pop-up modal\n::: {.rave-modal data-type=\"botton\" data-class=\"btn btn-primary\" data-label=\"MacOS\" data-title=\"Prerequisite on MacOS\"}\n{{&lt; include _prerequisite_macos.md &gt;}}\n:::"

    "text": "RAVE: Reproducible Analysis & Visualization of iEEG \nRAVE is free and open-source software for the analysis of intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data, including data collected using strips and grids (electrocorticography, ECoG) and depth electrodes (stereotactic EEG). A sister package to RAVE is the YAEL electrode localization toolkit.\n  RAVE is easy to use and creates publication-ready figures with absolutely no programming. RAVE can import standard data formats, including Matlab and EDF, and is compatible with BIDS-iEEG. It runs on laptops, lab servers, or in the cloud. Since all user interactions take place through a web browser, the user experience is identical on Mac, Windows and Linux. Data from RAVE can be exported for analysis using other software (click here for a list of iEEG analysis tools). Conversely, outside results can be imported and visualized using RAVE’s visualization engine. RAVE provides templates to make it easy to create GUI-based analyses using the streamlined application programming interface.\nJoin our growing RAVE-iEEG community on Slack . E-mail slack@rave.wiki for an invitation.\nRAVE has been developed since 2017 with funding provided by NIH R01MH133717 , U01NS113339, and 1R24MH117529.

Check if you are logged into an admin account\nMacOS requires users to have administrator (admin) privileges to install applications. At several points during the installation, MacOS will ask for your account password to verify installation. Installation will fail if your MacOS account doesn’t have admin privileges.\n\nHow to check if I have an admin account?\n\nOpen Terminal (in the /Applications/Utilities folder). Copy the command line shown below into the terminal window.\n sudo ls\nYou will be prompted for a password. This is the password of the MacOS account you are logged in as. If you have an admin account, MacOS will show the files in the current directory. If not, you will receive an error message. Alternately, click anywhere on the desktop to activate the MacOS menu bar, click on the Apple icon at the top left of the menu bar, then “System Preferences” or “System Settings”, then “Users & Groups”. Find your current account and verify that it has admin privileges.\n\nWhat if I don’t have an admin account?\n\nYou will need to create a new account with admin privileges or change the privileges of your current account, see https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-users-groups-settings-mtusr001/mac . If your computer is administered by others, ask them to create an admin account for you.\n\n\n1. Install R, version 4 or higher\nClick here to install the latest version of the R language for Mac. Find the latest package (.pkg) file, click to download, then open and install. There are different versions of R for older Macs with Intel CPUs and newer Macs with Apple CPUs (M1/M2). Choose the correct version, either “Intel 64-bit” or “Apple silicon ARM64”.\nTo verify R installation: R will be installed in the /Applications folder. Open this folder and double-click on the R icon to start R. After starting R, we recommend that you right-click on the R icon in the Dock and select “Options”/“Keep in Dock” to make it easier to launch with a single click. We also recommend starting R, opening the “Preferences”/“Startup” tab, and change “Save workspace on exit from”R” to “No”. Uncheck the box “Read history file on startup”. To check the current version of “R”, start R and enter the following into the console:\nR.version\nThis will produce a number of lines of output, beginning with something like\n platform       x86_64-apple-darwin17.0     \n arch           x86_64\n\n\n2. homebrew package manager\nInstallation requires the latest version of the homebrew package manager. Open Terminal (in the /Applications/Utilities folder). Copy the command line shown below into the terminal window.\n/usr/bin/env bash\nCopy the line below into the terminal window.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nThis step will take several minutes to complete. Wait until the installation is finished and the command prompt reappears before moving to the next step.\nAdd brew to your path or the next installation steps will fail. The installer provides the necessary command lines in the Terminal window at the conclusion of the previous step. Execute them in the same terminal window by copying and pasting. They will look something like\necho 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nThese commands will not produce any output.\nTo verify brew installation: Copy the command line shown below into the terminal window.\nbrew --version\nShould produce a result like\n Homebrew 3.4.1\n Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision f03c984ad7; last commit 2022-03-08)\n\n\n3. Install libraries using brew\nEnter this command into the terminal window:\nbrew install hdf5 fftw pkg-config cmake libpng\nThis step will install the hdf5 (high-performance file system), fftw (fast-fourier transform library), pkg-config (package configuration toolbox), cmake (cross-platform make for compiling optional packages such as ant), libpng (library for manipulating png images) and takes several minutes to complete. Wait until the installation is finished and the command prompt reappears before moving to the next step.\n\n\n4. Finished with prerequisites\nScroll to the top of the page and click on the “Install” tab to return to the full installation guide.\n\n\n5. Troubleshooting\nYou may receive this message\n Warning: macOS is reporting that you have not yet agreed to the Xcode license. This can occur if Xcode has been updated or reinstalled (e.g. as part of a macOS update). Some features (e.g. Git / SVN) may be disabled.\nTo make this error go away, open the Terminal app in the Applications folder, enter\nsudo xcodebuild -license accept\nThen restart RStudio.

Install compiling tools and system dependencies\nOpen a new terminal window, copy the installation script generated from the last step into this new window. For example, on Ubuntu 20.x,\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential file git psmisc procps sudo wget make cmake \\\n libsodium-dev libffi-dev libbz2-dev libpcre2-dev libcairo2-dev libssh2-1-dev libtiff5-dev libv8-dev \\\n libicu-dev zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev \\\n libfribidi-dev libharfbuzz-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev pandoc libxml2-dev git libgit2-dev \\\n libfftw3-dev libhdf5-dev libglpk-dev libgmp3-dev libzmq3-dev python3\nThe packages libv8-dev is for V8 package to enable JavaScript. libxml2-dev is for xml2. libfftw3-dev libtiff5-dev are necessary for fast-fourier transformations and libhdf5-dev is for reading and writing data in open data format HDF5. All the other packages are necessary for devtools (compilers)\n\n\n5. Install the free version of RStudio Desktop here:\nGo to https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and download one with keywords “Ubuntu xxx/Debian xxx” (depending on your system version), move the downloaded file to your desktop, rename it “rstudio.deb”.\nOpen terminal, type the following command in your terminal\ncd ~/Desktop\nsudo dpkg -i ./rstudio.deb \nand RStudio should be in your application list.

If all the core packages are up-to-date, you will see the message “Everything is up to date”, otherwise please follow the following steps. Quit all instance of R and RStudio before proceeding, or RAVE will not be able to update. Restart R and enter the following command into the R console :\nlib_path &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"RAVE_LIB_PATH\", unset = Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\", unset = .libPaths()[[1]]))\nloadNamespace(\"ravemanager\", lib.loc = lib_path)\nravemanager::update_rave()\nPress “enter” if you are asked “yes/no/cancel”.\nAfter this command completes, quit and restart RStudio. Then restart the updated RAVE:\nrave::start_rave2()\nNotes: Be sure to quit ALL other running R and RStudio instances before running “ravemanager::update_rave()”, otherwise packages will be locked and upgrade will fail. For other problems, the fallback is to completely reinstall RAVE.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
