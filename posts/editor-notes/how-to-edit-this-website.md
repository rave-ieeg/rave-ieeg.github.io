This post is an introduction on how to edit the website (rave.wiki), which completely runs on Github with no dedicated hosting servers.

To start, you must have a Github account and must apply to be a member of [`rave-ieeg`](https://github.com/rave-ieeg/) group. 

## Create a new documentation

All the documentation files are stored at directory [posts/](https://github.com/rave-ieeg/rave-ieeg.github.io/tree/main/posts), which contains several folders that roughly classify the documents. 

To add a new documentation page, first open [https://github.com/rave-ieeg/rave-ieeg.github.io/tree/main/posts](https://github.com/rave-ieeg/rave-ieeg.github.io/tree/main/posts). Then select a proper folder for the document, click on "Add File" button (see Figure 1), and click on "Create new file".
